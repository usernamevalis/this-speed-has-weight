project repo for the Workshop in Plataforma Bogota April/March 2018
<br>

Basic nodejs server communicates with p5js frontend over websockets. <br>
The server collects sensor information from an Arduino on the serial port and updates the p5js frontend using that information.<br>

The Arduio serial protocol is straight forward and easy add to more sensors/information. I will add descriptions shortly<br>

Still to do:<br>
Add boot scripts for RPI<br>
Add install / setup scripts for nodejs for RPI<br>
Add Arduino code<br>
Extend socket API<br>
Develop p5js template<br>

Basic nodejs server communicates with p5js frontend over websockets. <br>
The server collects sensor information from an Arduino on the serial port and updates the p5js frontend using that information.<br>

The Arduio serial protocol is straight forward and easy add to more sensors/information. I will add descriptions shortly<br>

Still to do:<br>
Add boot scripts for RPI<br>
Add install / setup scripts for nodejs for RPI<br>
Add Arduino code<br>
Extend socket API<br>
Develop p5js template<br>


<b>Instructions:</b>

This following instructions will install the Arduino IDE, the NPM package manager and setup the template project.
Dont forget to change your timezone and enable SSH if you need it. You can do this by running the following cmd in the terminal:

`sudo raspi-config`

Make sure you are connected to the internet

1. Download the repository with the following terminal cmd:
      
    `cd ~/ && wget https://github.com/usernamevalis/this-speed-has-weight/archive/master.zip`

2. Unzip the downloaded folder and make the install script executable:

    `unzip master.zip && chmod +x this-speed-has-weight-master/setup-scripts/install.sh`

3. Run the install script inside of the 'setup-scripts' folder

    `this-speed-has-weight-master/setup-scripts/./install.sh`
